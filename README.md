##  Overview
The Ride Booking Backend is a scalable and secure NestJS application built to manage a complete ride-hailing ecosystem. It provides RESTful APIs for riders, drivers, and admins, featuring real-time ride requests, driver tracking, and payment integration.
Itâ€™s designed using Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for efficient data modeling and supports JWT-based authentication, role-based access control, and email OTP verification for secure user onboarding.
